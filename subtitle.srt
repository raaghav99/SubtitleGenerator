1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Clash! God vs. Ryoutsu!

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Senpai! Senpai!

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Please wake up early! You'll be late!

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Noisy!

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Are you going to wake up soon?

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
What is that bookshelf?

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It was noisy, but I slept well.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
What is it, a chicken?

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
This looks like a chicken!

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It's a chicken!

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
This is an eagle!

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Ryoutsu-san! Don't run away!

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It's not a chicken!

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It's really a chicken

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
How much is it in grams?

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It becomes a side dish for rice.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
You can't run away like this!

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Even if I do this here, there is no specification.

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Let's go to work for now.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Good morning

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Ryoutsu!

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
What time do you think it is?

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You have a sense of self-awareness as a full-fledged member of society.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Manager!

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Stay tuned

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
What's wrong, Ryotsu! Did you eat something bad?

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I thought you were acting like a human for a while now.

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I can't believe I'm really no longer human.

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Maybe this is a transfer?

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Huh? Transferred?

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Ryo-chan is always doing bad things

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
God in heaven punished me

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Tell me what wrong I did!

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Don't tell me!

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
That's right! If you're going to complain, you should tell it to God!

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yeah!

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
That's certainly true

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm going to heaven for a while

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Are you coming?

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Do you know where it is?

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's called heaven, so it's up in the sky!

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
There's no way rockfish can fly, right?

44
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Wow!

45
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It flew away!

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's a rockfish

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Does God exist?

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
If you don't let me see it, I'll be in trouble!

49
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
If I leave him alone any longer,

50
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I don't know what to do!

51
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Damn! What is heaven like?

52
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Come on!

53
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
tired!

54
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Aaah! Iâ€™m going to lose!

55
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Oh! There's no doubt about it! This is heaven!

56
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Yay! Where is God?

57
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Ryochikankishi came to complain!

58
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Hey! Where are you! Where are you! Where are you! Where are you?

59
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Hmm! Well, you ran away before I saw you coming!

60
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
For now, let's leave proof that we came here.

61
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Smooth and smooth

62
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
This is fine

63
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Hohohohohoho

64
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
What is this voice?

65
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
god

66
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Is it God? Where is it?

67
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I've been right in front of you ever since.

68
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Holly

69
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Wow!

70
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
What do you think? I'm God

71
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Koke!

72
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Koke!

73
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
No, I can't walk on my feet if it's this big.

74
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
If you're careless, you might get trampled on.

75
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
That's totally annoying

76
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I don't want you to say that

77
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
God is omniscient and omnipotent

78
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
There is no such thing as carelessness.

79
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
That's why I know what you want to say

80
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I turned you into a chicken because you exceeded 20,000 points for bad behavior.

81
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
What is the point of that bad behavior?

82
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Points are given to every bad behavior of humans.

83
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
1 point for lying

84
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
If you do a good job, you get 10 points.

85
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
If you exceed 10,000 points in total, you will be sent to hell after death.

86
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And if you exceed 20,000 points

87
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Koke!

88
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's a rule to become a chicken.

89
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I won't do anything that bad.

90
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
sweet sweet

91
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's written in God's notebook.

92
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Do you think I'll leave it to you?

93
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
When you were a baby, you stole the bottle from the baby next to you.

94
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
First 12 points

95
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
A habitual offender of flipping up skirts in elementary school

96
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
122 points now

97
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
In junior high school, I played a prank on the principal.

98
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
222 points now

99
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Oh

100
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
And even after becoming a police officer, I was late.

101
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I don't know how many times I've slacked off.

102
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
And yesterday

103
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
The taiyaki that Manager Ohara bought.

104
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Hurry up

105
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
That's 20,000 abuse points.

106
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Ahhh

107
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Wait a minute

108
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
picture?

109
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
When I calculated it, it didn't add up to 20,000 points.

110
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
picture?

111
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
no doubt

112
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
That's 19995 points.

113
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
picture?

114
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I calculated it twice.

115
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
picture?

116
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Why can't you even say that you're omniscient and omnipotent?

117
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm not an idiot

118
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Number 1 means that there will be 5 deaths.

119
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Human Bunzai also used defense.

120
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
This crime is serious

121
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
35,000 additional abuse points

122
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
What are you doing?

123
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Anyone with a total of more than 55,000 points becomes a fly.

124
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It's not dirty.

125
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Bring it back

126
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
picture?

127
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
picture?

128
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
This is already

129
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Message from Goddess

130
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
picture?

131
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Goddess's message

132
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Well, what's the phone number?

133
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
If you're on the phone

134
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Return me to my original form

135
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back

136
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Totally annoying fly

137
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back

138
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Jeez

139
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back

140
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Like this

141
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back

142
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Noisy

143
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Ah, I'm back to being human.

144
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
What are you doing here? Let go of me!

145
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
People like you who don't even fear God will go to hell and the far east.

146
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
He's a god

147
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
What would you do if you suddenly threw it and died?

148
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
What?

149
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
He's a living human being, my king.

150
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
what

151
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
To be sent to hell alive

152
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
That guy is pretty evil.

153
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's been a long time since someone I've met has arrived.

154
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Who are you?

155
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I am the ruler of hell

156
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
King Enma

157
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
hell's suffering

158
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It will give you plenty of flavor, human.

159
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Today is a fun date with the goddess

160
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Now, what clothes should I wear?

161
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
What?

162
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
God it's hard

163
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
What on earth is going on?

164
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
The forces of hell have invaded heaven

165
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
what

166
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
what

167
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
what

168
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
But King Enma is not so foolish as to disobey me.

169
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Apparently, there was a revolution in hell recently and a new leader took over.

170
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
King Enma

171
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, guy

172
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Shoot, shoot, shoot

173
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Okay, shoot, shoot, shoot.

174
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'll show God the power of hell

175
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
What does it mean to go to war with God?

176
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
After all, this is not an opponent we can win against.

177
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Hey

178
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
what are you doing

179
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Yeah?

180
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
If you have time in your pocket, just work quietly.

181
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Yes

182
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Utsumi-juku and Yellow River-juku will collapse.

183
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Half of heaven is already a sea of â€‹â€‹fire.

184
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Did you know, God?

185
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Foolish people, realize the power of God.

At the time of underground bridge Ranbu creation Team personnel issues Traffic safety Yakiniku set meal

188
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Underground bridge dance

189
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Mr. Ranbu

190
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Oh, God, you've been so rough.

191
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Eh, even though you're a human, you're surviving well with the current attacks.

192
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Don't think it'll stay like this, God.

193
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Well, you live in a pretty nice place, don't you?

194
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Ah, it smells good

195
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Oh, look at something nice

196
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Let's eat

197
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
delicious

198
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Shit, just take a carefree bath

199
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Today I have a date with a goddess

200
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
A wig is useful in times like this.

201
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
But this is a secret that no one knows about.

202
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
If it were found out, God's authority would be disrespected.

203
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Oh, even worse, Goddess will hate me.

204
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Ah, I saw it.

205
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
you

206
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I thought it was suspicious that even though he was a god, he had a pants perm.

207
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I'll give everyone the flu

208
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Oh, stop it

209
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Everyone in heaven

210
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
God's head is actually

211
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
return to ground

212
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
It was a dangerous place.

213
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Hey, Senpai, where did you come from?

214
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Oh, oh, is this inside the emission center?

215
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Yay, yay, yay!

216
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I was worried, Ryo-chan.

217
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
It's true, I didn't come back for a week.

218
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Hey, Ryotsu, take this as an opportunity to change your attitude in life so you don't become a chicken again.

219
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Hey, it's okay

220
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
what's okay

221
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I'll never be a chicken again

222
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
because

223
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
because

224
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I hold God's weakness

225
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
god's weakness

226
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Yes, only here

227
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
In fact, the hair on God's head is

228
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Well, senpai

229
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Ryo-chan

230
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Don't worry, I'm just unconscious

231
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Even if I'm not that surprised

232
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
i am god

233
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Ah, you are God

234
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I saw it for the first time

235
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
They usually don't come down to the human world.

236
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:35,000
However, I don't know how much trouble it will cause to those around me if I leave this man alone.

237
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Above all, if the wig was revealed, I would want to live.

238
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Now that I think about it, this guy

239
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Well, I said that I had grasped God's weakness.

240
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I claimed to have grasped God's weakness.

241
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Doki

242
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Hohoho, there's no way God has any weaknesses.

243
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
No doubt, this one is definitely

244
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
reveal my secret

245
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Well, bad people have to stand up from the ground up.

246
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Extract the root of evil from this man

247
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
evil exorcism

248
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
You did something unnecessary to me.

249
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Shows things to the eyes

250
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
It's money, it's money

251
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Wow, what the hell

252
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I need to do something soon

253
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
There's no need to panic.

254
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Humans have an evil heart and a conscience

255
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
If you make them fight, conscience will always win.

256
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Come out, conscience.

257
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Um, no reaction at all.

258
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:55,000
M-money-money

259
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Conscience, come out, conscience, come out, conscience, come out, come out.

260
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Money

261
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Hey, can't you hear me? My conscience, my conscience, my conscience.

262
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Hmm, this guy doesn't seem to have a conscience.

263
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Money

264
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,000
It's money, it's money

265
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
The power is amazing because it is a mass of desire.

266
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
If you leave it alone, you'll be in trouble.

267
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
If this happens, I guess I'll have no choice but to stop it.

268
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Mei, prepare for battle

269
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Come on, I'll be your opponent.

270
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
What is this guy trying to do?

271
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Transform

272
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
What do you think? Money is well spent.

273
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
It's definitely a win

274
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Money

275
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Money

276
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Money

277
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Definitely a win

278
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
decided

279
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
left straight

280
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
What do you think, did you realize that?

281
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Please be sweet

282
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
It is said that there is no one who laughs at one yen.

283
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Make sure you have plenty of change, too.

284
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Yeah, it's time to get over it

285
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:00,000
It's gold after all, it's strong.

286
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
What do you think?

287
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I apologize for the inconvenience, I will put the evil spirit out of business and become a conscience.

288
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
That's true, okay

289
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Taking what the evil spirits say seriously

290
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
After all, it's the money of the world, money.

291
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I'm sorry

292
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
God, I have a good idea.

293
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
picture?

294
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Hmmmm, I see.

295
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Hey demon, look at that.

296
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Isn't that a money tree?

297
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
With this, you don't have to worry about money

298
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Oh!

299
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Yeah!

300
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Fly to the end of the universe

301
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Destroying himself with money was a typical end for him.

302
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Ryo-chan, Ryo-chan!

303
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Huh? I didn't expect this.

304
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Yunto?

305
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Excuse me

306
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
alien!

307
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Look at this

308
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Ryo-chan!

309
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Our planet was troubled because of this man.

310
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Our stars are in trouble because of this guy

311
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Please do something about it

312
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Ha, I can't believe I'm causing trouble even if I go to another planet.

313
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
It's a stain on the earth, really.

314
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Money, money!
